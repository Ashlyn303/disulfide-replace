# Data Dictionary - Rosetta Output CSVs

This document explains the columns and metrics found in the summary CSV files generated by the Rosetta evaluation pipeline.

## Rosetta Energy Units (REU)
All "score" columns represent the **Rosetta Total Score**, measured in **REU (Rosetta Energy Units)**. 
- **Lower is Better**: A more negative score indicates a more stable, energetically favorable structure.
- **Reference**: These scores are usually calculated using the `ref2015` scoring function.

## `results/tables/rosetta_fastrelax_summary.csv`

Generated by `./runit_fastrelax_parallel.sh`. Contains statistics for multiple stochastic replicates.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `filename` | The cleaned mutant ID referencing the source PDB structure. |
| `group` | The mutation cluster (e.g., G1, G2). |
| `mutations` | Full string of amino acid substitutions (e.g., L6LEU-L81LEU-C24ALA-C98ALA). |
| `rep1` ... `rep20` | Total scores for each individual FastRelax replicate. |
| `avg_score` | The arithmetic mean of all replicates. **Primary metric for ranking.** |
| `std_score` | Standard deviation across replicates, indicating convergence stability. |

## `results/tables/rosetta_minimizeenergy_summary.csv`

Generated by `./runit_minimizeenergy.sh`. Contains deterministic scores from local minimization.

| Column | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `filename` | The original mutant PDB filename. |
| `score` | The final Rosetta score after energy minimization. |
| `description` | Internal Rosetta tag (usually the filename). |
| `group` | The mutation cluster (e.g., G1, G2). |
| `mutations` | The specific mutations applied to this structure. |
